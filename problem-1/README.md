## Problem-1

Converted the app from Lab 1 to a react application.

## Problem-2

A simple external API was integrated to fetch random quotes and display them in the notes.\
The [Quotable REST API](https://api.quotable.io/random) was used as the external API.

## Problem-3

The application was extended by adding 3 functionalities:

### Search

Allows users to search for specific notes based on the note-content.

### Filter

Allows users to filter notes based on the color.

### Note Sorting

Allows user to sort notes based on criteria such as the date-added, color or alphabetical order.
